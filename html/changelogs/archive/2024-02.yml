  CASEY GUNGEON (CASEYGUNGEON):
  - config: added FFPROBE_PATH config
  - qol: jukebox songs now sort and filter by artist for easier menu navigation
  - server: jukebox audio files can now have metadata parsed by ffprobe if ffmpeg
      is installed. it won&#x27;t bother if FFPROBE_PATH isn&#x27;t set, so if you
      don&#x27;t want it just don&#x27;t use it.
